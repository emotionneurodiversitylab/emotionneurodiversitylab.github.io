Today we participated in a resource fair for Philadelphia students at the Aspira Education Campus.  The kids had fun participating in lots of activities, while dancing along to a very eclectic DJ.  The grownups occasionally succumbed to dancing as well :)

ENL made a field trip to the annual meeting of the International Society for Autism Research (INSAR).  Jess, Calli, and Yvonne presented on emerging results on the elicitation of valenced facial expressions in autism, and on the ages at which neurodivergent children are diagnosed and captured by CHOP's Electronic Medical Health record.  Congrats for some fantastic presentations!
